This is a guess that posenet and bvh were meant to be together



example webcam machine learning posenet  
https://hpssjellis.github.io/beginner-tensorflowjs-examples-in-javascript/tf-examples/posenet/camera/index.html


my code for it is at   
https://github.com/hpssjellis/beginner-tensorflowjs-examples-in-javascript/tree/master/tf-examples/posenet/camera


Original tfjs-models code at 
https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet/demos





What's the point.

Load the bvh onto premade models for   
https://www.blender.org/download/


Premade models can be got from
